//simplest application: checkout and load a single commit

//is this better as a bash script that uses git directly?

//api
//authorize github api

//request repo + commit
//find commit diff and generate playable demo for that file (scope for now is just Pico-8)
//repeat to generate website


//potential other idea: make this website interactive. if a user requests day 60, this will generate whatever was updated on day 60.

//bash path
//git checkout
//run some other build script
//git checkout repeated
